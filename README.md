# Custom Terminal Setup

This is a custom terminal setup that allows you to execute commands directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

To set up the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Copy the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your project files.
2. Customize the styles in the `styles.css` file to match your design preferences.
3. Add or modify commands in the `terminal.js` file to extend the functionality of the terminal.

## Creating Commands

To create a new command, follow these steps:

1. Open the `terminal.js` file in your text editor.
2. Locate the `commands` object.
3. Add a new key-value pair to the `commands` object, where the key is the name of your command and the value is a function that defines the behavior of the command.
4. Inside the function, you can use the `consolelog` function to output messages to the terminal, interact with the DOM, or perform any other actions you need.
5. Save the `terminal.js` file.

Here's an example of how to create a simple command that logs a greeting message:
```javascript
greet: function () {
  consolelog("Hello, welcome to the terminal!");
}
```
## Running the Terminal

To run the terminal, open the HTML file in your browser. You should see the terminal interface displayed in the browser window.

## Using the Terminal

Once the terminal is running, you can type commands into the input field at the bottom of the terminal interface and press Enter to execute them. The output of each command will be displayed in the terminal window.

Here are a few example commands you can try:

- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.
- `clear`: Clears the terminal output.
- `aboutblank [url]`: Opens a new tab with a blank page and loads the specified URL in an iframe.
- `cloak [image-url] [new-tab-name]`: Changes the favicon and tab title of the browser window.
- `devtools`: Loads and initializes Eruda, a browser debugging tool, on the current page.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the terminal interface, commands, and functionality to suit your needs. You can add new commands, change the styling, or add additional features as desired.

Enjoy coding your custom terminal!
